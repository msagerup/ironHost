### *** Iron Host ***

####This is an experimental Rust application.

The goal is to use chat gtp to build back-end servers to fetch data based on a user input. 

#####'ie.' Get statistics form 'house fires caused by pets'

The AI agent will then fetch the data, another agent will build the back-end, another will build the front-end to present the data. 

### WIP. 

(and will probably be in "WIP" for some time, as this is the first Rust application I'm building )
