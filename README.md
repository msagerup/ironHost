# **IronHost: Data Fetching Engine in Rust**

## **Current Phase: Experimental**

IronHost is an experimental Rust project designed to dynamically generate its own back-end infrastructure based on queries processed by a GPT-based chat agent.

### **Sample Scenario:** Fetching "House Fires Caused by Pets" Data

The project follows this architecture:
- A GPT-based agent receives a query and processes it.
- Rust code dynamically generates the back-end logic needed to fetch and process the corresponding data.
- A front-end layer (also dynamically generated) presents the processed data to the user.


## **Project Status: Work in Progress**

 The project is continuously being updated.
